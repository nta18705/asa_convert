# asa_convert
Conversion Utility for Cisco ASA Firewall configs > Cisco FirePower

Connects to the FMC and uses the FMC API to upload new objects and ACLs converted from the provided ASA config.

Run parser.py to parse the ASA config and create objects on the FMC
Run test_acls.py to parse the ASA config and create the relevant firewall rules on the FMC

This is still in an early state - use at your own risk!
